            <h2>Seven: the number of completeness and perfection. The offering: an immovable narrative, rooted in
                perpetuity and unbound by time.</h2>
            <img src="../img/fearBG2.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Two years in the making – the seventh collection rooted in easy elegance, our history and your
                reality;
                introduces suiting, knits and accessories to our audience for the first time.</p>
            <p>Traditional tailoring is transformed, adapted and updated in the form of transitional and
                trans-seasonal
                fits. Crossing disciplines and re-envisioning formalwear through the lens of modern functionality
                and
                performance needs, to continually challenge received notions of what contemporary fashion is today.
                Juxtaposing time-honored and contemporary fabrics with our signature considered yet understated
                finishes
                to sit seamlessly alongside our staple denims, cottons, canvases, leathers and suedes in enduring
                silhouettes for yesterday, today and tomorrow.</p>
            <p>
                Wool and cashmere knits present an elegant evolution of our classic sweatshirts and hoodies, while
                bags
                and belts, devoid of the distraction of hardware, are pared down to the purest version of themselves
                meeting at the convergence of fashion and function.
                The Seventh Collection also marks the unveiling of a new iteration of our FG logo in a
                military-inspired
                stencil font and a tribute to America’s favorite pastime, baseball, with a new lineup of stylized
                graphics celebrating The Negro Leagues.
            </p>
            <p>Inspired by our own journey navigating the path from nowness to eternality, The Seventh Collection
                marks
                our coming of age.</p>
